          subtitle: "Hello! I am a postdoctoral fellow in Developmental Psychology at Fordham University. I got my Ph.D. in Human Development and Family Sciences 
                     from University of Texas at Austin.
                    
                     <br><br>
                     In 2025/2026, I am on the academic job market!

                     <br><br>
                     My research focuses on understanding the health and well-being of ethnically-racially diverse adolescents and their parents within intersecting 
                     cultural, family, and neighborhood contexts. I have expertise in daily-level and longitudinal analyses, applying advanced statistical methods to
                     address questions in developmental and health sciences.

                     <br><br>
                     I grew up in Xi‚Äôan, one of the oldest cities in China with a history of over 3,000 years and the capital of thirteen ancient dynasties. 
                     Known as the starting point of the ancient Silk Road, Xi‚Äôan is home to iconic landmarks such as the Terracotta Army and its well-preserved city walls.

                     <br><br>
                     I‚Äôm passionate about Broadway and West End musicals üé≠, exploring the world üåç, capturing moments through photography üì∏, and caring 
                     for my plants üå±.
